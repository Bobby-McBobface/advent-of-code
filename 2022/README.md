# Me doing Advent of Code 2022

2022 is my first<sup><sub>*</sub></sup> year doing Advent of Code. It's also my first dive into competitive programming. I'll start at midnight EST try to get on the global leaderboard, but I doubt I'll get on haha. My language of choice is Python and I will post my solutions here (not that anyone cares).

<sup><sub>* I did 3 questions in 2021 but I cheated</sub></sup>
